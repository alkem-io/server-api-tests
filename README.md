# Alkemio Test Suites
Alkemio quallity assurance packages.

##
This repository contains three core elements:
* Tests Library: for shared components that can be re-used across test suites
* Test Suite **Server-API**: used to validate the Alkemio server api.
* Test Suite **Client-web**: used to validate the Alkemio client web interaction.

The above are the maintained test suite related packages.

To do:
* There is a testOld directory that contains scripts / other work that has been carried out over the years and that will need to be cleaned up
* Bring back in the use of Husky
* Migrated code that is duplicated between client-web + server-api to be in the tests-lib package
